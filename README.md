# Improving-sign-language-accessibility-with-deep-learning-based-hand-gesture-recognition
This project focuses on helping people with hearing and speech disabilities by converting hand gestures into text or voice using deep learning. The system captures hand movements through a camera, processes the image, and identifies the sign using a trained deep learning model.
